Retrieving a Project from Perforce

To obtain access to files in Perforce depots, you define connections to servers. Using the connections, you can browse the contents of Perforce servers in the P4 Connections view. By default, all files in the depot are displayed, but typically you have access only to a subset of the files (depending on how your Perforce client view is defined). To display only the file to which you have access, click down arrow and choose Filter by Client Workspace from P4 Connections view menu.
