All v files are created read-only, and you should not change the permission of those files.
The directories inside the repository should be writable by the persons that have permission
to modify the files in each directory. This normally means that you must create a UNIX
group (see group(5)) consisting of the persons that are to edit the files in a project, and set
up the repository so that it is that group that owns the directory. (On some systems, you also
need to set the set-group-ID-on-execution bit on the repository directories (see chmod(1))
so that newly-created files and directories get the group-ID of the parent directory rather
than that of the current process.)
