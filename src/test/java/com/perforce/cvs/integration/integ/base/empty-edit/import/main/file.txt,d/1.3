Installing the Broker 
--------------------- 
Unix

To install P4Broker on Unix and Linux systems, download the 
p4broker executable from the Perforce Web site to a suitable 
directory on the host (such as /usr/local/bin). To ensure that 
the binary is executable, set the appropriate permissions. 
For example:

     cp /tmp/p4broker /usr/local/bin chmod +x 
     /usr/local/bin/p4broker
