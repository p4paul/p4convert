Because there are 2 forms for representing (some) characters in
Unicode, it's possible to produce different sequences of codepoints
meaning to indicate the same sequence of characters [1].  UTF-8, the
internal Unicode encoding of choice for Subversion, encodes codepoints
in (a series of) bytes (octets).  Because the sequences of codepoints
specifying a character may differ, so may the resulting UTF-8.  Hence,
we end up with more than one way to specify the same path.
