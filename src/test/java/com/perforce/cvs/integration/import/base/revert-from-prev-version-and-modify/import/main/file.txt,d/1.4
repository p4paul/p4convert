If you are interested in having your repository on a different file system, you should first set (in .bash_profile or .cshrc etc) CVS_RSH to ssh.

Now you can check out a project from the different filesystem with the -d option, which tells CVS to use a different repository, and the :ext to tell it to use an external location. For example:

cvs -d :ext:bah@lelandmachine:/afs/ir.stanford.edu/users/b/a/bah/cvsroot checkout cvsexample

Now all your cvs commands will run through ssh to the remote system. You can avoid typing your password every time by putting the appropriate public key in your .ssh/known_hosts file. Since the remote repository location is stored in CVS/Root, you only have to type the :ext part once.
