@Checkpoint files

A checkpoint is a file that contains all information necessary to re-create the metadata in the Perforce database. When you create a checkpoint, the Perforce database is locked, enabling you to take an internally consistent snapshot of that database.

Versioned files are backed up separately from checkpoints. This means that a checkpoint does not contain the contents of versioned files, and as such, you cannot restore any versioned files from a checkpoint. You can, however, restore all changelists, labels, jobs, and so on, from a checkpoint.
