@Creating a checkpoint

Checkpoints are not created automatically; someone or something must run the checkpoint command on the Perforce server machine. To create a checkpoint, invoke the p4d program with the -jc (journal-create) flag:

p4d -r server_root -jc

You can create a checkpoint while the Perforce service (p4d) is running. The checkpoint is created in your server root directory (that is, P4ROOT if no server_root is specified).

To make the checkpoint, p4d locks the database and then dumps its contents to a file named checkpoint.n in the P4ROOT directory, where n is a sequence number.

Before unlocking the database, p4d also copies (on UNIX where the journal is uncompressed, renames) the journal file to a file named journal.n-1 in the P4ROOT directory (regardless of the directory in which the current journal is stored), and then truncates the current journal. The MD5 checksum of the checkpoint is written to a separate file, checkpoint.n.md5, and the lastCheckpointAction counter is updated to reflect successful completion.
