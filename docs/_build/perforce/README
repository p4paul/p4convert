_build
======

This directory contains the Apache ANT-based build infrastructure for
transforming Perforce guides in DocBook XML into PDF and HTML. The
following provides a brief overview of the structure and content of this
directory.

assets/                 directory contains one directory for each available
                        transformation target. A transformation target is a
                        combination of an ANT build target and the assets in the
                        identically named folder. For example, to produce a PDF
                        version of a guide, within the guide's directory you
                        would invoke "ant pdf", which executes the 'pdf' target
                        in build.xml, which uses the asset files within
                        'assets/pdf'.

common_xml/             directory contains DocBook XML files that most, if not
                        all, guides require.

build.properties        declares properties that are transformation-independent,
                        e.g. specifying which XSLT processor to use.

build.xml               contains the ANT targets used to transform guides into
                        various forms.

global.properties       declares a mix of ANT and DocBook XML properties that
                        provide defaults for all transformations.

indexer.py              is a Python script that produces inverted indexes which
                        are used in the HTML presentation to faciliate searching
                        within a guide.

sample_oxygen.catalog   If you use the oXygen XML editor, customize this file to
                        to specify where the common_xml and manuals directories
                        have been sync'd on your system. Then configure oXygen
                        to use this catalog file to allow oXygen to validate our
                        DocBook XML guides.
